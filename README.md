# Hbridge_MOSFET

This is the code for controlling a dc motor with H bridge MOSFET!

....

In this circuit, we are going to use to type of MOSFET Transistor:

1- SI2333DS - P channel that can easly run with 12v drain source voltage and Id= 4.1A > 3A

2- 2N7002H - n channel that can run with 5 voltage of the Arduino.
