# Hbridge_MOSFET

This is the code for controlling a dc motor with H bridge MOSFET!

....

The motor will rotate clockwise for 5s then it stops for a second and then rotate counterclockwise for another 5s.

In this circuit, we are going to use two type of MOSFET Transistor:

1- SI2333DS - P channel that can easly run with 12v drain source voltage and Id= 4.1A > 3A

2- 2N7002H - n channel that can run with 5 voltage of the Arduino.
